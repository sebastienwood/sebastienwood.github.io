### Bio
I'm a student @ Polytechnique Montreal, soon to be in PhD. Field of interest in machine learning, optimisation and related challenges. 

#### Master in Industrial Engineering and Mathematics (Exchange program with Polytechnique Montreal, QC Canada)
Program : renewable development, globalisation and international firms, UX design, AI, Deep Learning

#### Engineer in Industrial Engineering and Management (Master at Grenoble INP, France)
Specialisation in Supply Chain Engineering. Relevant themes : operational research, combinatorial optimisation, scheduling, project management, data science, robotics/embedded system (entry level). 

#### DUT in Quality Logistics and Organisation (Lorient, France)

### Publications

- *Using deep learning approaches to overcome limited dataset issues within semiconductor domain* (M. Omrani Tamrin, S. Henwood & al, 2019) - to be presented at NEWCAS 2019. We make use of VAE and GAN with an extremely limited dataset (approx 20 samples) of wafers. Results are compared given the likelihood of the generated wafers (human evaluation). We show that GAN manage to achieve a convincing result, while VAE fails. Future work will make use of this result to build an automated anomaly detection tool making use of the intrinsic understanding of the anomaly that the GAN would allow to.
