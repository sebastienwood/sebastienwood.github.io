Hi again !

### Bio

I'm a student @ Polytechnique Montreal in Research Master ! ^\_^ . I'm here as an exchange student from Grenoble Institute of Technology, with a major in Supply Chain Engineering.

My research is focused on applying Deep Learning on complex system monitoring where expert knowledge is, right now, always mandatory. The goal is to have a plug in model which would squeeze the useful information out of the big data at our disposal into a much more understandable representation. This representation would exhibit at least the information necessary to detect failures. Given its newly won "representational simplicity" we should be able to perform a simple unsupervised anomaly detection.

My interests at the moment lies in Deep Learning/Optimization, but I enjoy going in diverse fields.
